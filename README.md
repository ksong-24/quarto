# STEM-EXP 2023 - Internship @ NYU VIDA: Quarto and OpenSpace

## Project Description

This internship was a part of my experience with the STEM-EXP program at The Peddie School. I interned for six weeks at the VIDA lab at NYU Tandon, under the mentorship of Ylva Selling. For this internship, my objective was to experiment with the tools in Quarto within OpenSpace. This is a pilot project for Quarto's integration into Openspace. I explored the capabilities and limitations of the various tools in Quarto, and worked with the OpenSpace API to integrate the program into the GUI.

OpenSpace is an open source, non-commercial, and freely available interactive data visualization software designed to visualize the entire known universe and portray our ongoing efforts to investigate the cosmos. Bringing the latest techniques from data visualization research to the general public, OpenSpace supports interactive presentation of dynamic data from observations, simulations, and space mission planning and operations. More information on OpenSpace can be found on [their GitHub](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace) or on [their website](https://www.openspaceproject.com/).

### Quarto

Quarto is an open-source software built to improve the process of creating, publishing, and collaborating on scientific and technical documents. Its capabilities include support for various languages, such as Python, Observable JS, Julia, and R, as well as various outputs, such as HTML, MS Word, LaTeX, and more. In this project, I used a combination of Python and Observable JS code, although I had also experimented with other languages. I created outputs in both HTML and RevealJS presentation formats. More information on Quarto can be found on [their website](https://quarto.org/about.html).
